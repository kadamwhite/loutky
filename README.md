# Loutky

This is my own personal project boilerplate. It gives me (and you) an [Express](expressjs.com) server, then sets us up to use [Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) via Express middleware. Edit the name of the package, edit your routes, and go&mdash;scripts are in `/public/scripts`, styles are in `/public/styles`.

## Installing & running the application

To install, run `npm install`: this will pull down all the project's dependencies.

Once installed, use the command `npm start` to spin up the development server, which will then be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
